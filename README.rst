CorporaCreator
==============

This is a command line tool to create Common Voice corpora.


Installation
===========

After checking this repo out one installs the corresponding python package as follows

``CorporaCreator$ python3 setup.py install``


Usage
===========


Given the ``clips.tsv`` file dumped from the Common Voice database one creates a corpora in the directory ``corpora`` as follows

``CorporaCreator$ create-corpora -d corpora -f clips.tsv``

This will create the corpora in the directory ``corpora`` from the ``clips.tsv`` file.

Each created corpus will contain the files ``valid.tsv``, containing the validated clips; ``invalid.tsv``, containing the invalidated clips; and ``other.tsv``, containing clips that don't have sufficient votes to be considered valid or invalid. In addition it will contain the files ``train.tsv``, the valid clips in the training set; ``dev.tsv``, the valid clips in the validation set; and ``test.tsv``, the valid clips in test set.

The split of ``valid.tsv`` into ``train.tsv``, ``dev.tsv``, and ``test.tsv`` is done such that the number of clips in ``dev.tsv`` or ``test.tsv`` is a "statistically significant" sample relataive to the number of clips in ``train.tsv``. More specificially, if the population size is the number of clips in ``train.tsv``, then the number of clips in ``dev.tsv`` or ``test.tsv`` is the sample size required for a confidence level of 99% and a margin of error of 1% for the ``train.tsv`` population size.

By default no sentence occurs more than once in ``train.tsv``, ``dev.tsv``, and ``test.tsv``. However, one can relax this constraint using the ``-s`` command line parameter. The value of ``-s`` is the number of repeats allows for a sentence. So, for example, if one wanted to allow for a sentence to occur 3 times in a corpus, then one could use

``CorporaCreator$ create-corpora -d corpora -f clips.tsv -s 3``

With or without the use of the ``-s`` command line parameter, the result of running ``create-corpora`` will be a directory containing the following files::

Introduction
------------

The purpose of the ``create-corpora`` command line tool is to provide a jumping-off point for contributors. The data in the alpha release of the Common Voice data is, unfortunately, in need of cleaning and the ``create-corpora`` command line tool provides a plugin for each language that allows for the language communities to aid in cleaning the data.


Cleaning Sentences
------------------

The ``clips.tsv`` file is a `tab separated file`_ containing a dump of the raw data from Common Voice with the following columns:

1) ``client_id`` - A unique identifier for the contributor that was randomly generated when the contributor joined
2) ``path`` - The path the the audio file containing the contribution
3) ``sentence`` - The sentence the contributor was asked to read
4) ``up_votes`` - The number of up votes for the contribution
5) ``down_votes`` - The number of down votes for the contribution
6) ``age`` - The age range of the contributor, if the contributor reported it
7) ``gender`` - The gender of the contributor, if the contributor reported it
8) ``accent`` - The accent of the contributor, if the contributor reported it
9) ``locale`` - The locale decribing the language the contributor was reading
10) ``bucket`` - The "bucket" (train, dev, or test) the clip is currently assigned to

Our problem is that data in the column ``sentence`` needs to be cleaned, as there are various problems with the data in the ``sentence`` column. For example, some sentences contain HTML fragments. Some contain spelling errors. Some contain digits, e.g. "Room 4025" that allow for many valid readings. Some contain errors which we at Mozilla are not even aware of.


Language Independent Cleaning
``````````````````````````````

To correct these problems we outfitted ``create-corpora`` with a plugin `common.py`_ that is responsible for cleaning sentences in a language independent manner. For example, if a sentence contains HTML fragments, then the HTML fragments would be removed by `common.py`_.

The language independent cleaning is done by the ``common()`` method in `common.py`_:

::

    def common(sentence):
        """Cleans up the passed sentence in a language independent manner, removing or reformatting
           invalid data.
        Args:
          sentence (str): Sentence to be cleaned up.
        Returns:
          (str): Cleaned up sentence. Returning None or a `str` of whitespace flags the sentence as
                 invalid.
        """
        ...
        # Clean sentence in a language independent manner
        ...
        return sentence

This method is input the sentence to clean, cleans the sentence in a language independent manner, and returns the cleaned sentence.

If the sentence is not able to be cleaned, e.g. it consisted only of HTML fragments, this method can return ``None`` or a string containing only whitespace to indicate the sentence was invalid to begin with.

Currently `common.py`_ decodes any URL encoded elements of sentence, removes any HTML tags in a sentence, and removes any non-printable characters in a sentence, in that order. (For the details refer to `common.py`_ .) This seems to catch most language independent problems, but if you see more, please open an issue or make a pull request.


Language Dependent Cleaning
``````````````````````````````

In addition to the language independent plugin `common.py`_  ``create-corpora`` has a plugin for each language in the alpha ``clips.tsv`` release. Each one of these plugins is responsible for cleaning the sentences in its corresponding language. So, for example, there is a plugin `en.py`_ for English that is responsible for cleaning the English sentences.

The language dependent cleaning is done by an appropriately named method in the language's plugin. So, for example, the cleaning for English is done by the ``en()`` method in `en.py`_:

::

    def en(client_id, sentence):
        """Cleans up the passed sentence, removing or reformatting invalid data.
        Args:
          client_id (str): Client ID of sentence's speaker
          sentence (str): Sentence to be cleaned up.
        Returns:
          (str): Cleaned up sentence. Returning None or a `str` of whitespace flags the sentence as invalid.
        """
        # TODO: Clean up en data
        return sentence

This method is input the sentence to clean along with the client_id of the contributor who read the sentence. It then cleans the sentence in a language dependent manner and returns the cleaned sentence.

If the sentence is not able to be cleaned, e.g. it is so mangled that it is impossible to determine how to correct it to a valid English sentence, this method can return ``None`` or a string containing only whitespace to indicate the sentence was invalid to begin with.


Language Independent vs Dependent Cleaning
``````````````````````````````````````````

Of note is that in the language dependent case the method that does the cleaning takes not only the sentence but also the client_id of the contributor who read the sentence. In the language independent case this client_id was not present. However, for the language dependent case it's unfortunately required.

A sentence may contain text which is able to be read in many different, but valid, ways. For example, the sentence "I am in room 4025." can be validly read as "I am in room four oh two five". Equivalently, a valid reading is: "I am in room four zero two five". There are also other valid readings: "I am in room forty twenty five.", "I am in room four thousand twenty five."... To actually determine which of these readings a particular contributor gave, you have to listen to the audio, determine what they said, then replace the digits with text reflecting the contributor's reading, returning this cleaned sentence.
